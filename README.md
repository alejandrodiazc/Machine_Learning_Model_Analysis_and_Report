# Machine_Learning_Model_Analysis_and_Report

The following report aims to explain and analyze the performance of a machine learning model implementation; for this particular case, a Neural Network model was developed through the SciKit Learn libraries. The NN is intended for solving multilabel classification tasks.

For the whole training and testing process of the Neural Network, a Palmer Archipielago Penguin database was used; this database contains information that allows to solve a classification problem, which consists in determining the species of a penguin based on certain features.

First, for getting the optimal model, a Gridsearch was perfrormed, aiming to get the best parameters for the neural network construction. Once the model was determined, validations were done in order to approve the model for predictions.

Once training and testing was done, several metrics were obtained in order to check if the model worked correctly when making predictions for each of the three possible outputs.

Later on, details will be given on the implementation and each particula task that was performed.
